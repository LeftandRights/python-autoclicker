# Python Tkinter AutoClicker
![UI Interface](https://github.com/LeftandRights/python-autoclicker/blob/main/images/interface.png)

Through the code might be messy, but as long as it works, that’s what matters, and it’s free anyway. I’ve added as many features as I could think of, and they should be enough to automate simple tasks based on image detection and more.

## Features

### 🎯 Click Recording & Playback
- Record your mouse clicks and replay them as many times as you need.
- Supports repeating the recorded sequence for automation.
- Adjustable delay between clicks for better customization.

### 🖼️ Image-Based Clicking
- Click on specific images on the screen with customizable confidence levels.
- Supports grayscale scanning for better recognition in different lighting conditions.
- Works great for automating tasks that require clicking on UI elements that change slightly.

### 📍 Custom Click Regions
- Define specific areas where the auto-clicker should scan for images or colors.
- Useful for targeting specific parts of an application or game.

### 🔄 Looping Options
- Set a fixed number of loops or run the auto-clicker indefinitely.
- Perfect for repetitive tasks that require multiple passes.

### 🎮 Hotkey Support
- Quickly start, stop, or record clicks using keyboard shortcuts.
- Makes it easy to toggle automation without disrupting your workflow.
